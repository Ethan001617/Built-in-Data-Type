# Built-in-Data-Type
Once again I want to tell y'all that in Python we do not define data types., However, you should know that which data types are support in Python so that you can write programs better.

These Data type are provided by Python language
Following are the Built-in data type:-

None Type

Numeric Type

Seqences 

Sets

Mappings

This is not User difined data we'll see it seperately because it has an Array, Class which is very big topic.
It also has some big topics like. Lists, Tuple, Dictionary, Mappings.So we will take small introductions of this, but keep in mind that the rest have a very big concept, they have to be read in detail.so that you can write programs better.
So the basic that we see in all languages, we see them and then we will see the big topic separately.

#None Type
None Data Type represents an object that dosen't contain any value.
It is very similar to the Null type which is read in Java.

# Numeric Type
TO BE CONTINUE TOMORROW....
