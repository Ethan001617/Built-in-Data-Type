# Built-in-Data-Type
Once again I want to tell y'all that in Python we do not define data types., However, you should know that which data types are support in Python so that you can write programs better.

These Data type are provided by Python language

Following are the Built-in data type:-

None Type

Numeric Type

Seqences 

Sets

Mappings

This is not User difined data we'll see it seperately because it has an Array, Class which is very big topic.
It also has some big topics like. Lists, Tuple, Dictionary, Mappings.So we will take small introductions of this, but keep in mind that the rest have a very big concept, they have to be read in detail.so that you can write programs better.
So the basic that we see in all languages, we see them 

and then we will see the big topic separately.

# None Type
None Data Type represents an object that dosen't contain any value.
It is very similar to the Null type which is read in Java.

# Numeric Type
Following are the numeric Data Type:

Int

Float

Complex

# Int Data Type:

The Int Data Type represents an integer number. An integer number without any decimal point or fraction part. In Python, it is possible to store very large integer number as there is no limit for the size of an int datatype

Lets Understand With Example:
                            
                            Etha_n = 10
                            print(Etha_n)
#If you want to check its type , then there is a function for it
                            
                            type(Etha_n)
#It will tell us which type of variable it is.                            
 
 # Float Type:
 The Float datatype represents floating numbers. A floating point number is a number that contains a decimal point
 
 Example:
        25.5, 15.5, 16.8, -0.8, -7.4
        
        price = 16.8
        run_rate = -0.8
        print(price)
        type(price)
        value = 5.1e5 (# here 5.1e5 is it is specific notation where e or E represents exponentation which represents the power of 10 [5.1 x 10(5)]
 # Complex:
 A Complex number is a number that is written in the form of a + bj or a + b. where
 
a = Real part of the number
 
 b = Imaginary part of the number 
 
 j or J = Square root value of -1 
 
 a and b may contain integer or float number
 
 Ex: 5+7j, 0.5+2J
